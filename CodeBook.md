# Code Book

## subject
The first column is the subject number.  This identifies the unique subject(person). Range: 1-30.

## activity
The second column is the activity name. Values:
- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING

## Average Values
The remaining columns contain the average of all measurements for a given subject/activity combination.  Measurements in the original dataset were normalized and between -1 and +1, so the averages are also between -1 and +1.

In the following list of variables:  
* '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
* '.mean.' denotes that this value is the mean of the mean of the measurements
* '.std.' denotes that this value is the mean of the standard deviation of the measurements

A full description of the measurements may be found in the original dataset's features_info.txt file.
